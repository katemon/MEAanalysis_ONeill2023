% LFP_EXTRACTGUI - a graphical interface to analyze MEA sweep data 
% 
% This utility allows you to set or adjust the parameters necessary 
% to extract some features of one or more sweeps recorded with MCRacks. 
% It currently requires that a datastream object named 'D' has been 
% created beforehand, e.g. with the 'load sweep data' tools of the MEA-Tools. 
%    Some of the settings must be entered manually or by clicking at 
% appropriate positions in trace displays, for others suggestions 
% are shown as defaults. 
% It is necessary that you fill all fields and activate the settings 
% of the fields marked with an asterisk (*) at least once per session, 
% e.g. by clicking on the popup-menus. 
%    Settings can be saved/restored to files, to help you to 
% protocol the settings used with a particular dataset. This is 
% implemented by saving the GUI as an m-file/mat-file from the 'Options' 
% menu.  The configuration can also be stored in a structure and may then 
% be viewed by writing the same structure to the base workspace with 
% the 'save to workspace' button. 
% 
% Most field have a tooltip associated that is displayed when you 
% move the mouse over this field/button/window. 
% 
% This tool consists of the following major sections 
% 
% - Definition of the data set that should be analyzed 
% - Definition of the trigger times 
% - Definition of templates that should be subtracted 
%   from the data before they are evaluated, e.g. to remove stimulus 
%   artifacts 
% - Definition of the output and configuration variables, and the plot 
%   or autosave conditions. 
% - an Options menu 
% 
% Details of the individual entry fields and functions in these 
% sections are described below. 
% 
% Currently the procedure finds minimum and maximum in data within 
% the time range set by 'fit range limits' and the minima/maxima of 
% the polynomial fit on the data for each trigger and each sweep. The 
% result is written to a rather complex variable as described the 
% 'lfp_extract.m' help section. They can be viewed and separated for 
% further processing with 'MEA-Tools/Display Functions/evaluate LFP 
% features' menu. 
% 
% Clicking on the RUN button will start the retrieval and calculation. 
% Since this can become a long procedure if many sweeps are evaluated 
% at a time you might want to test your settings on a few sweep first. 
% The results are written into a variable in the base workspace which 
% will be stored at the end of the process if the 'autosave' option is 
% active.

%                      ----------------- 
% DATA DEFINITION 
% Entry fields      '&lt;text&gt;'  refers to fields or field entries. Default 
%                   values are stored in lfpextract_defaults.cfg. 
% 
% sweep ID range  - indices to the sweeps in your files entered as list 
%                   or range, e.g. &lt;1 5 7&gt; or &lt;1:3&gt;, or as a variable name 
%                   holding these. The sweeps will be batch-processed 
%                   when RUN is pressed. 
% data range limits- the time range of a sweep to display hereafter. 
% 
% reference electrode 
%                 - the electrode to show for range selection by mouse 
%                   clicks, visible only when 'mouse select' is checked. 
% plot button     - draws a trace from the first sweep given from the 
%                   reference electrode and asks you to click on the start 
%                   and end position of the range you want to use as 
%                   &lt;data range&gt;. 
% 
% FILTER DEFINITION 
% filter type     - a choice of filters you can apply to the data before 
%                   further processing, the field below it changes 
%                   depending on your choice and suggests defaults 
%                   appropriate for the filter type. Enter as many 
%                   numbers as the defaults show, e.g. 1 for the moving 
%                   average, 2 for Savitzky-Golay filters. The defaults 
%                   will provide considerable smoothing of the data. 
%                   Larger numbers for the boxcar and for the first value 
%                   of the Savitzky-Golay will enhance smoothing, both 
%                   refer to the number of samples that go into the filter 
%                   design. 
%                   Increasing the second value for Savitzky-Golay will 
%                   keep the resulting curve closer to the raw data. 
% filter configuration 
%                 - settings for the filtertype selected. For moving averages 
%                   the no. samples across which the filter averages is 
%                   given/entered. For Savitzky-Golay filters the coefficients 
%                   with which the filter is generated are requiered. 
% 
% TRIGGER DEFINITION 
% trigger electrode 
%                 - the electrode to use for trigger-time selection by 
%                   mouse click. 
% pre-trigger limit 
%                 - the pre-trigger range to use for baseline correction, 
%                   in a future version. 
% post-trigger-dead time 
%                 - post trigger range before the actually evaluated range 
%                   starts, prepared. 
% trigger position 
%                 - times of the trigger events relative to the beginning of 
%                   the sweep, you can select it on a sample trace 
%                   from the trigger electrode. 
% max no. of triggers 
%                 - limits the number of trigger events used. This will be 
%                   necessary for automated trigger detection in a 
%                   later version. 
% 
% EVALUATION WINDOW 
% evaluation window extent 
%                 - data range used for feature extraction and polynomial fit 
%                   on the data. Together with the trigger times and the post- 
%                   trigger-dead time this defines the data windows to be 
%                   evaluated. After each trigger, the data during the dead time 
%                   is ignored, then the stretch up to the end of the evaluation 
%                   range is evaluated. 
%                   (The polynomial fit is currently not available. It will 
%                   be used to calculate the slope and extrema of a dataset 
%                   with less interference by noise and sampling accuracy. 
%                   The fitted line will be shown in the results plot if the 
%                   'polynomial fit' checkbox is on. Note that polynomial fitting 
%                   is currently disabled.) 
% display time units 
%                 - time units used for trace displays, usually &lt;ms&gt;, may be 
%                   changed to &lt;s&gt; or &lt;us&gt;. 
% results variable 
%                 - the name of the variable in which the results should be 
%                   stored. Exisiting variables of that name are overwritten! 
% config. structure 
%                 - the name of the structure with the configuration settings 
%                   when they are saved to the workspace. 
% 
% TEMPLATE SUBTRACTION 
% subtract template 
%                 - allows subtraction of a template from the data before 
%                   processing when checked. Useful e.g. to subtract a response 
%                   recorded in Ca2+ free buffer, i.e. without synaptic 
%                   transmission, from the full response and then analyze 
%                   the remaining postsynaptic components only. 
% template variable 
%                 - the name of the variable holding the templates. It size 
%                   needs to be 64xMxN or 68xMxN where M is the length of the 
%                   sweeps and N can be any number of templates 
% index variable  - list or variable name with integers pointing to the 3rd dimension 
%                   of the template variable for each sweep to be evaluated. 
%                   The format can be any string that could be used as a matlab 
%                   command. If only one integer is given, this index will be 
%                   used for all sweep. 
% 
%                   Examples (omit the outer quotes): 
%                   To subtract the same template from every sweep in 
%                       the "sweep ID range" 1:3 you would enter '1' in the 
%                       index variable field. 
%                   To use a different template for each of these 3 sweeps 
%                       enter '1 2 3' if these templates are stored in the 1st, 
%                       2nd and 3rd plane of the template variable ('1:3' 
%                       is equivalent). 
%                   If you have 3 templates, each of which should be used for 
%                       5 consecutive sweeps you could use either: 
%                       '1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3', 
%                       'repmat([1:3]',1,5)', or a workspace variable holding 
%                       these sequences. 
% new template    - this button will open a script that helps you to generate 
%                   templates from sweeps. 
% 
% CHECKBOXES 
% use differential 
%                 - use the differentiating version of the Savitzky-Golay filter 
%                   (only effective with this filter). See 'help savgol' for 
%                   additional information. 
% detrend trace   - detrend the trace in the evaluation window by subtracting a 
%                   line drawn betw. the first and last value before the analysis. 
% plot results    - shows the values projected onto the traces in 8x8 subplots. 
%                   deactivate this option during batch processing unless 
%                   you want to inspect each sweep processed individually. 
% set artifact to NaN 
%                 - set all values in a time window around the trigger times 
%                   to NaN before filtering the data. This will result in 
%                   gap at all traces positions influenced by these data in 
%                   this window after filtering. Useful to omit data points 
%                   from high frequency stimulus artifacts and the like. 
% autosave        - saves the result at the end of the calculation to a 
%                   mat-file. When you check the box you are asked for a 
%                   filename.
