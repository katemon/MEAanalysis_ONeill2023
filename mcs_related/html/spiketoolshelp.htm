% Spike Tools are designed to load, view, sort and analyze specific aspects 
% of electrophysiological spike data recorded with the MCRacks multi-electrode 
% array system for 8x8 MEAs. Many features rely on this file structure, 
% or the arrays created thereof, some can be used with any matlab-array. 
% We will expand the flexibility to use other formats as time allows. 
% 
% !!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!! 
% Spike Tools require spike cutouts that are created by the spike detector 
% tool in MCRack. In Matlab, you can see whether this data stream exists 
% when you create the datastream object. Spike cutouts have the streamname 
% 'Spikes 1' (the number may change). 
% 
% Spike Tools will NOT work on streams named 'Electrode Raw Data'! 
% 
% How to proceed: 
% First of all, the spike data, the waveforms need to be extracted from the 
% datafiles to retrieve spike times, allow calculations necessary for spike 
% sorting and to review the data. The matlab data structures created during 
% this process are currently used as global variables in many of the components 
% and therefore can be used only if their names are not changed. 
% 
% The essential variables in the workspace are 
% SPIKETIME              spike times given in microseconds 
% SOURCECHANNELNUMBER    a number giving the electrode in matlab indices for 
%                        8x8 matrices. 
% RACKSETUP              a structure holding information written to during 
%                        the experiment. ChannelNames, MicrosecondsPerTick 
%                        and ChannelID lists are subfields of RACKSETUP. 
% PARSESETUP             information collected during data processing. 
% PARMAT                 a parameter matrix describing principle component 
%                        contributions and other features of each spike 
% spkpointer             a pointers into the data file for each spike 
% 
% During spikes sorting newly assigned electrode-subnames are collected 
% in PARSESETUP and identifiers for spike cluster membership of each spike 
% are listed in CLUSTERNUMBER. 
% 
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
% 
% Spike Tools currently holds the following tools: 
% 'Parse Spike Files'         - read the spikes from the original data files 
%                               and calculate descriptive parameters (currently 
%                               principle components), save the results as mat-files 
% 'Load Mat-Files'            - load such files 
% 'calculate principle components from a matrix' 
%                             - calculate principle components from matrices 
%                               with one spike waveform per column, one channel only. 
%                               Parameters are requested by a dialog box. 
% 'define/edit RACKSETUP'     - collect the entry fields used in RACKSETUP from 
%                               a datastream object or enter them manually when 
%                               working with matrices. See 'help racksetupdef' for 
%                               more information 
% 'import/export spike data'  - 'import SPIKE 2 cutouts': import spike waveform from 
%                               Spike2 files. See 'help readspike2data' for more details. 
%                             - 'export cluster IDs to Spike2': export cluster IDs 
%                               generated during spike sorting for importing with 
%                               Spike2. See 'help writecn2spike2' for more details. 
%                             - 'export spikes to Nex/GDF ASCII files': write spiketimes 
%                               to ascii files in electrode/cluster and timestamp 
%                               format. The resulting file has 2 columns suitable 
%                               for import into NeuroExplorer (TM). See 'help 
%                               writemcs2neximp' for more details. 
% 
% 'Spike Data Summary'        - review the current dataset 
% 'Sort Spikes'               - sort the spikes according to these parameters, 
%                               this includes tools to review spike shapes. The final 
%                               parameters and cluster boundaries are stored to a 
%                               files whose names are generated from the source 
%                               files name. Spike data are stored as a mat-file, 
%                               cluster vertices in a text-file with the extension 'sortlog'. 
%                               See 'help sorthelp' for details. 
% 'Reuse Sorting Parameters'  - a script guiding you through applying the same 
%                               spike sorting sequence to a new data set, thus 
%                               creating comparable cluster assignments 
% 'Merge spike data files'    - a script guiding you through the process of merging 
%                               sorted data from successive recordings into a single 
%                               dataset. The resulting dataset cannot access the 
%                               original raw spike data files (i.e. shapes). Sorting 
%                               should therefore be finished before merging. 
% 'Spike Rate Analysis'       - different tools to calculate and display spike rate 
%                               based on moving window rate estimation.
